## May 16, 2018

# Intro
REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer. It is web standards architecture and HTTP Protocol. The REST architectural style describes six constraints that were originally communicated by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation and defines the basis of RESTful-style as:

Uniform Interface
Stateless
Cacheable
Client-Server
Layered System
Code on Demand (optional)
RESTful applications use HTTP requests to perform four operations termed as CRUD (C: create, R: read, U: update, and D: delete). Create and/or update is used to post data, get for reading/listing data, and delete to remove data.

RESTful is composed of methods such as; base URL, URL, media types, etc.
